# SQLite_Prototype

For this first run the example_create_table.py file.  This will create the database.db file that has the variables table to interact with.

Next you can run either the example_read_db.py or example_user_program.py files to interact with the database.  Both are only
read operations.

The example_drop_table.py is incase you muck about with the table and it gets messed up.  You can drop the table and start again.
